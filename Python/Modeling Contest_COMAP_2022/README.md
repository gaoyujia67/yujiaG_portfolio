# Mining Equity

Type: The Mathematical Contest in Modeling 2022. Chose Problem F.

My role:

- Produced visualizations to enhance data comprehension
- Took primary responsibility for crafting the final report. Specifically, I contributed 60% of the content to the "Mining Equity_Report".

*In my opinion, the Tech-Communication role in the modeling contest is also vital, even though it may look more inferior than people who did coding and modeling. However, it requires a comprehensive understanding of our model and the methodologies we used to effectively contribute to the report.*
