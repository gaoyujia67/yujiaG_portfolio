##### Analysis of the impact of weathering on ancient glass and prediction of its composition based on statistics and machine learning detection and identification

Type: The Mathematical Contest in Modeling in China. Problem C.

*Modeling problem and the report are in Chinese.*

My role:

- Responsible for the Chi-squared test in Problem 1.
- Contributed 70% of writing in the final report.

*In my opinion, the Tech-Communication role in the modeling contest is also vital, even though it may look more inferior than people who did coding and modeling. However, it requires a comprehensive understanding of our model and the methodologies we used to effectively contribute to the report.*
