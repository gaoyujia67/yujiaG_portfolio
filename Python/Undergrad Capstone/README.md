# Undergraduate Capstone Project
Type: Group work of five.

## Project Description
This project, sponsored by Shanghai Systence, addresses inaccuracies caused by rivet vibrations during manufacturing, which have prevented their products from meeting client requirements. The project aims to develop a cost-effective system to capture and analyze these vibrations and provide recommendations to mitigate them. To fit the company’s specific requirements on accurate visualization and analysis of vibrations, we have identified engineering specifications including mass, volume, price, system processing time, sensor resolution, repeatability, response time, frequency response range, error range, and success rate. 

Our system consists of a hardware set, which includes a Keyence displacement laser sensor, an amplifier, and an Arduino board, as well as a software interface built using PyQt in Python; hardware captures raw data and sends digital signals to computer for visualizing vibration patterns and identifying anomalies. The total cost was RMB 1004. All concepts were chosen based on budget limit and meeting specifications. Validation results indicate that our product meets the target values across all specifications, except for the system’s success rate in detecting vibration amplitude and frequencies. Currently, our system achieves the desired success rate only when detecting conditions with large vibrations. However, in cases of small vibrations, the hardware we selected limits detection capabilities due to its minimum detectable difference. This limitation arose because we were unaware of the exact vibration extent in the riveting process when choosing the hardware. Consequently, future work will involve using a more precise microcontroller for higher accuracy. Through actual experiments, we found that vibration amplitude is significantly affected by the width of the U-shaped part and the input pressure for riveting, while the peak vibration frequency remains unaffected by these factors. We hope this project will help Shanghai Systence control the riveting process more effectively, saving time and energy, and enhancing their market competitiveness.

## My role
Our team, comprised of students from Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Mechanical Engineering (ME), and Material Science Engineering (MSE) majors, divided the project into two primary parts: ECE tasks and ME/MSE tasks. The ECE group was tasked with designing and building the data collection hardware, including the laser sensor, sensor amplifier, power supply, Arduino board, and the user interface. Additionally, the ECE team conducted experiments and analyzed the results. The ME/MSE group focused on designing and manufacturing the U-shaped part, trying to simulate the riveting process in Ansys, and determining the parameters that significantly impact vibration amplitude to propose solutions. Despite the ECE group appearing to have more tasks, the ME/MSE group faced the challenge of learning Ansys, a time-consuming and complex software, which balanced the overall workload between these two subgroups.

As an ECE student, my responsibilities encompassed technical tasks and technical communication within the team. My technical duties included selecting the sensor concept, collaborating on the design of data gathering and UI concepts, implementing the static plot function in the user interface, and participating in drafting the UI layout in PyQt, which laid the foundation for the final design. I conducted experiments on the machine, troubleshooting errors and bugs, such as discrepancies in peak amplitude display. I also plotted FFT patterns of our system and the benchmark on the obtained experimental data, analyzing the results to identify potential explanations. Alongside teammate Heng Zhao, we built an amplifying circuit based on Professor Huang's suggestions to enhance our system's sensitivity to tiny vibrations. In terms of technical communication, I contributed to writing my assigned sections of reports, the thesis, and presentation slides. I also took on the task of refining teammates’ writings to ensure consistency in format and tone, avoiding redundancy across sections. I managed the logical flow of the entire report, even for sections outside of my expertise, by actively engaging with responsible teammates to understand and clarify their content. I created the project poster and presented on behalf of the group for the Literature Survey and Improved Tech-Comm presentations. Additionally, I consistently updated the group on assignment guidelines, prepared the LaTeX report format, and took responsibility for logistics, such as purchasing devices and booking meeting rooms.

In terms of workload distribution, I estimate my contributions as 35% in coding, 45% in writing and maintaining format and logic, and 50% in conducting experiments and data/results analysis. On average, I spent a significant number of hours on this project each week, ensuring that the final product met our group's high standards.
