In this repo, I've compiled my previous experiences in Data Analysis, focusing on three key aspects: 
- **Python**: This section encompasses my course projects and participation in Math Modeling Competitions, where I applied machine learning, data cleaning, and visualization techniques. Throughout these endeavors, I utilized Python libraries including  `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `sklearn` to accomplish various analytical tasks.
- **SQL**: This section features projects that I've undertaken utilizing SQL.
- **Visualization Designs**: This section contains static and interactive visualizations I've made using *Tableau* and *Python.Altair*.
